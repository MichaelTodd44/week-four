Start simple, and push yourself into the more complex materials.

Begin with some Excel basics

Load some data into Voyant-Tools and explore the patterns

Consider the power of collocation with AntConc

See if a topic model might usefully surface some patterns.

Even before looking through the basics of Excel and R, I drew back upon my days within Highschool which has been roughly four years ago, as I've only ever had to use Excel for one course which was Accounting. I was orignally going to be going into Accounting, as I was naturally good at it. However, I did not expect it to be useful in the field of Digital History, as most History essays and papers I've read, are first-hand documents, etc, etc, rather than actual data. It's just an interesting process which has blown me away in regards to 'Medieval History' to Modern History methods.
Working with the Excell spreadsheet, I never actually used the Charting tool before, and it was unbelievable how useful it would be to see your data on a painted map.
I finally got RStudio working, as it seemed my Anti-Virus was blocking it without me even knowing it. Therefore, I took some pictures as proof to, which was also rather intriguing to see. However, due to my inept coding skills and lack of experience with Sublime Text, I am still unsure as to what to do with the files such as Tarsus.txt and unicorn.txt
I will say this on record, so that only you and I know Professor. But Voyant Tools is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen in regards to preparing for work. I'm baffled many other courses I've had to use never this use, especially in regards to the Corpus regarding 18 and 19th century England. Which is a fascination of mine. It's absolute breathaking.

This was interesting to me in the fact despite England still being named United Kingdom, United has been mentioned 558 times, whilst Kingdom only 373 times. I would make a hypothesis at this time that England was more focused upon enveloping ideas of unity amongst the Kingdoms of Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and England together, by consistently mentioning united or unity in itself. Endland itself was only mention 108 times, whilst Scotland and Glasgow, were mmentioned almost 400 times.
